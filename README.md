# THYME

A food-management app that keeps track of all the food in your fridge, pantry, freezer or anywhere else you might store food.  Ability to add containers, join them, edit, add items and keep track of expiration dates.  Our app also offers you a real time price tracker that helps you visualize how much money you spend in a given amount of time and more importantly how much money you are wasting by letting your food go bad. This app is perfect for room mates sharing a fridge, a parent keeping track of the families' food in a pantry, or even a restaurant owner that wants to manage their food inventory.
